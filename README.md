#### User Story
* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

#### Business Context
A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

## Usage

The user loads the page, then it should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with the last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.
